## 🚂💺💻📝 **Railways Reservation System in C Language**

This is a basic simulation of an online railway reservation system, built using the C programming language. It aims to replicate the core features of a typical online booking system, and includes the following functionalities:

**🔑 Login system**: The system allows an administrator to login and edit the database, ensuring that the data remains accurate and up-to-date.

**🚊 Train details**: Users can view the available trains and their respective schedules, helping them to plan their travel more effectively.

**👀 Check seat availability**: The system enables users to check the availability of seats on a particular train before they book their ticket, ensuring that they can plan their travel without any last-minute surprises.

**🎫 Reservation of tickets**: Users can reserve their tickets for their preferred train, ensuring that they have a confirmed booking before they start their journey.

**❌ Cancellation**: The system provides users with the flexibility to cancel their tickets at any time, making it easier for them to change their plans if needed.

This project is a great starting point for anyone who is interested in learning more about the C programming language or wants to build a basic reservation system. Feel free to use it as a reference or a learning resource for your own projects.
